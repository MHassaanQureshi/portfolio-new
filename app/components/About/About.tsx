      <span className="text-center mt-4">
        Hi, I&apos;m Hassaan, a passionate front-end developer dedicated to crafting interactive and visually appealing web experiences. I specialize in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, constantly pushing my limits to build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I&apos;m expanding my skills in full-stack development while pursuing my Computer Science degree at Federal Urdu University Karachi. Additionally, I&apos;m enrolled in the Governor Sindh Initiative for AI, Web 3.0, and Metaverse, where I continuously explore cutting-edge technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over time, I&apos;ve worked on several projects, including a resume generator, an eCommerce website, a fashion app landing page, and a Facebook clone. I&apos;ve also participated in a 7-day hackathon, where I built a fully functional website using Sanity.io as the CMS and delivered a business pitch deck.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond development, I enjoy tackling new challenges, optimizing performance, and improving user experiences. I aim to contribute to innovative projects that bridge creativity with technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        ðŸš€ Let&apos;s build something amazing together!
